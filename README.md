# File assistant web service #

The local_ws_fileassistant Moodle web service helps accomplishing the task to push files from your 'private files' repository to a
Moodle course.

Since this functionality is missing but would be greatly appreciated by lecturers who want to create their own scripts to push their
lecture materials to their courses using the command line, here's a way to make this possible. Note this does not provide the
CLI commands, it does, however, allow files to be pushed into a section of a course.
